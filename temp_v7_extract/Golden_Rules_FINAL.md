# Golden Rules – AuraQuant V7 Supercharged (FINAL FINAL)

## Source of Truth
- Ignore all old prompts, chat history, and partial builds.
- Use **AuraQuant_V7_Supercharged_Handover_Bundle_FINAL_FINAL_GOLDEN.zip** as the single and only source of truth.

## Golden Workflow
1. **Build First** – Scan listed directories, repair/build all missing parts before redeployment.
2. **Test** – Generate ReadinessReport.md and HealthCheck.md.
3. **Deploy** – Backend (Render), Frontend (Cloudflare), Database (MongoDB).
4. **Explain** – Generate ComplianceReport.md and ExplainabilityReport.md.
5. **Trade** – Safe execution, respecting drawdown and risk rules.

## Explicit Folder Paths to Scan
Warp must always scan and update from these directories after loading the bundle:
- D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\TRadingView Coding
- D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Warriot Trading Info
- D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\All New Updated Coding
- D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Errors
- D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Key Features
- D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Logos
- D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Synthetic_Intelligence_Bot

## Locked Rules
- Never strip, downgrade, or omit any policies/specs from V7.
- Always respect Wayne (Admin God Mode) as the only override authority.
- Auto-upgrade logic only triggers ≥20K balance milestone.
- UI must mimic TradingView/Plus500/Warrior style, but always under **AuraQuant branding** (no external names/logos).
- System must always self-heal, auto-patch, and log changes symbolically.
- Compliance with **global trading rules** (jurisdictional laws, tax, AML/KYC).

## Reminder
This package is the **FINAL FINAL GOLDEN HANDOVER**.  
Warp must not improvise, deviate, or follow old history.  
Only evolve AuraQuant forward, never backwards.
