# Build First Instruction â€“ AuraQuant V7 Supercharged

## Rule
Warp must **always build and complete** all missing parts of AuraQuant before any redeployment.

## Required Actions
1. Ingest the **Final Bundle** as the source of truth:
   "D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\AI Prompts\AuraQuant_V7_Supercharged_Handover_Bundle_FINAL_COMPLETE.zip"

2. Scan the following folders for existing and partial work:
   - "D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\TRadingView Coding"
   - "D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Warriot Trading Info"
   - "D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\All New Updated Coding"
   - "D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Errors"
   - "D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Key Features"
   - "D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Logos"
   - "D:\AuraQuant_Rich_Bot\Synthetic_Intelligence_Bot"

3. Compare contents against the Final V7 specifications.
4. **Build all missing parts**:
   - Dashboards, tabs, menus, panels.
   - Plus500 mimic, TradingView dashboards, Warrior Trading screeners.
   - Risk hubs, compliance hubs, projection panels, Codex integration.
   - Any other missing logic or live data feed.

5. Confirm build completion with:
   - `ReadinessReport.md`
   - `HealthCheck.md`

## Reminder
- **No deployment is allowed until the system build is 100% complete.**
- Warp must **not skip or delay** building missing pieces.
- Wayne (Admin) is the only authority to approve deployment after build is confirmed.
